## ClojureScript Compiler Compiled with ClojureScript? ##

This is a **patched version of the ClojureScript compiler** that
compiles to ClojureScript. Normally, the ClojureScript compiler is
a pure Clojure program that runs on the JVM. This patched version runs
from the compiled JavaScript. This project was kicked off by
[kanaka](https://github.com/kanaka) and
[chouser](https://github.com/chouser) during some intense hacking at
Clojure/conj 2012. Kanaka continues to develop the fork towards the
goal of being fully self-hosting (i.e. ClojureScript-in-ClojureScript).

### Why?

* Why not?
* Compilers are only cool once they are self-hosting (can compile
  their own code). This fork is not self-hosting yet, but that is the
  goal.
* You can use ClojureScript without a JVM.
* You can have a [ClojureScript REPL web
  app](http://kanaka.github.com/clojurescript/web/jsrepl.html) that
  runs locally in your browser (no server involved after loading the
  page).

### Current Caveats

* JavaScript output is not optimized by the Google Closure Compiler
  (which is a Java program).
* The code changes are not all compatible with the normal Clojure
  ClojureScript (JVM based) compiler. To make it compatible we really
  need [Feature Expressions in Clojure](http://dev.clojure.org/display/design/Feature+Expressions)
* The :nodejs compilation target is currently broken. However, the
  `node/run.js` bootstrap script enables compiled CLJS code to be
  invoked that was not compiled with a :target.
* Other miscellaneous broken things that have not been tracked down
  yet.

### Bugs

- numeric keywords (:2) are broken
- anonymous functions do not warn about arity
- Unicode symbol breakage
- hex numbers "0x7e7"
- warnings during compile about *unchecked-if*


### TODOs

- update to upstream ClojureScript
- file I/O (at least on the node.js side)
- misc functionality: require, use, var metadata, :private def check
- self-hosting (compile ClojureScript compiler using node.js hosted ClojureScript compiler)
- optional optimizations (single JS file output, etc)
- tagged reader literals
- get test/cljs/cljs/core_test.cljs to load/run successfully
- line numbered errors
- single file output and performance optimizations (without unused code removal)
- better long line/multiline editing in web REPL

### Build

The ClojureScript-in-ClojureScript compiler is compiled using Clojure (i.e. on the JVM).

First, run `./script/bootstrap` which downloads the necessary dependencies: Clojure, Google Closure Library, Google Closure Compiler, and Rhino. This must be run from the root project directory.

Then, download the most recent version of closure-compiler from the [Google repo](http://dl.google.com/closure-compiler/compiler-latest.zip) and extract it to closure/compiler folder.

Finally, run `./script/compile` to build the compiler. This might give off some warnings, but that's okay.

You should now have a functioning ClojureScript compiler at `./bin/cljs`. 


### Usage

The `./bin/cljsc` script takes a file or project directory containing .cljs files. It creates an `out` folder with your compiled JavaScript.  It optionally accepts a second argument with Google Closure Compiler options, although it currently won't work with any optimization mode other than `{:optimizations :none}` (the default).

After building a cljs project, you will need to copy `./src/cljs/goog.js` into the `out` directory created by compilation if it doesn't already exist there.

### Examples

#### Web REPL
There is a sample project (a web-based REPL) you can build and play with inside the `web` directory.

It comes with a build script:

```
cd web
./build2.sh
```

Now open the `web/repl.html` file in a browser.

#### Node.js REPL

For a REPL in Node.js, build the `src/cljs/noderepl.cljs` code:

```
cd node
../bin/cljsc ../noderepl.cljs > noderepl.js
cp ../src/cljs/goog.js out/
```

Now use the `run.js` bootstrap code to launch the repl:

```
./run.js noderepl.js
```

#### Node.js compilation/evaluation
For direct *.cljs file compilation/evaluation, build the nodecljs.cljs compiler:

```
cd node
../bin/cljsc ../src/cljs/nodecljs.cljs > nodecljs.js
cp ../src/cljs/goog.js out/
```

You can now use a combination of the `run.js` bootstrap code and
`nodecljs.js` to compile/evaluate the `hello.cljs` file:

```
./run.js nodecljs.js hello.cljs
```



--------

## What is ClojureScript? ##

ClojureScript is a new compiler for [Clojure](http://clojure.org) that targets JavaScript. It is designed to emit JavaScript code which is compatible with the advanced compilation mode of the [Google Closure](http://code.google.com/closure/) optimizing compiler.

## Getting Started ##

* [Compare with JavaScript](http://himera.herokuapp.com/synonym.html)
* [Try it online](http://himera.herokuapp.com/index.html)
* Read the [Quick Start](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/wiki/Quick-Start) guide.
* Read the [Documentation](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/wiki).
* Look at the [Sample Applications](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/tree/master/samples).
